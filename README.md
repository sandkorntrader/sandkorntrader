## üíµ Step 1: Build a Financial Safety Net

Before investing, take care of your financial foundation:

| Goal | What to Do | Resource |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Emergency Fund** | Save 3‚Äì6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. | N/A |
| **Cut High-Interest Debt** | Avoid credit card interest by paying in full monthly. Switch mortgage payments to bi-weekly to save on interest. | [Mortgage Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/amortization-calculator.html) |
| **Use Tax-Efficient Accounts** | Max out 401(k) and HSA contributions. HSAs offer triple tax advantages. Only tap into them for medical needs if absolutely necessary. | [401(k) Limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits) <br/> [HSA Info](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969#en_US_2023_publink1000204024) |

Skipping these steps makes investing riskier and less effective.

## üìà Step 2: Start with Simple, Diversified Investing (ETFs)

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are collections of stocks bundled into one investment.

| Focus | ETF | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| U.S. Small Companies | IWM | Tracks the Russell 2000 Index |
| U.S. Large Companies | SPY, VOO | Follows the S&P 500 |
| Tech-Oriented Growth | QQQ | Tracks top 100 non-financial tech stocks |
| Semiconductors & AI | SMH, AIQ | Focuses on chipmakers and AI companies |
| Market Volatility | VXX | Moves with short-term market fear (VIX futures) |

[Compare SPY vs. VOO](https://www.etf.com/tools/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-SPY)

**Think of ETFs like investing in a full basket of stocks instead of picking one apple.**

## üìö Step 3: Learn Core Investing & Trading Concepts

Understanding these basics will make you a smarter investor.

| Term | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Expense Ratio** | Annual fund fee taken from your investment | Lower is better - it eats into returns |
| **NAV** | Price per ETF share based on total fund value | Helps assess fair value |
| **Bid / Ask / Spread** | Bid: buyer's offer; Ask: seller's price; Spread: difference | Smaller spread = lower trading costs |
| **Market Order** | Executes immediately at the best available price | Fast but less control |
| **Limit Order** | Sets your max buy/min sell price | Adds control, avoids surprises |
| **Slippage** | Trade executes at worse price than expected | Common in fast markets - use limit orders |
| **Stop / Stop-Limit Orders** | Sells when a price drops to (or below) a threshold | Useful for managing losses |
| **Trailing Stop** | Adjusts upward as the price rises | Helps protect gains |
| **GTC / Market Close / Open** | Controls timing of order execution | Useful for precise strategy |
| **Cash vs. Margin Accounts** | Margin lets you borrow; cash only uses your funds | Margin adds risk - be cautious |
| **Position Sizing** | How much money you put into a single trade | Prevents oversized losses |
| **Risk/Reward Ratio** | Balance of potential gain vs. risk taken | Aim for favorable ratios |
| **Support & Resistance** | Price points where stocks tend to pause or reverse | Helps set entry/exit levels |
| **Liquidity** | How easily you can buy/sell an asset | More liquidity = smoother trades |
| **Volume & Spread** | Validates movement strength | Avoid thin, volatile stocks |
| **Holding Periods** | Day = same day; Swing = days/weeks; Investing = long-term | Strategy affects taxes, risk |
| **Commissions & Fees** | What brokers charge per trade | Always check costs before trading |
| **Diversification** | Spread money across different assets | Reduces the impact of a single bad pick |
| **Dollar-Cost Averaging** | Investing a set amount on a schedule | Helps avoid market timing and smooths volatility |
| **Rebalancing** | Resetting your portfolio back to target allocations | Maintains your intended risk level over time |

### üß† Know Yourself: Behavioral Biases

| Bias | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Hating losses more than enjoying gains | Can cause you to hold losers or sell winners too early |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only paying attention to info that supports your view | Leads to poor research and blind spots |
| **Recency Bias** | Believing recent trends will continue forever | Causes poor timing decisions |
| **Overconfidence** | Thinking you‚Äôre better at this than you are | Often leads to risk-taking and avoidable losses |

**Tip:** Keep a journal of your decisions and learn from the outcomes.

### üîç Cost Basis: What You Paid Matters

| Term | Meaning | Why It Matters |

| **Cost Basis** | Price you paid (plus fees) | Used to calculate your profit or loss for taxes |
| **FIFO / LIFO / Low/High-Cost** | Methods for choosing which shares get sold | Affects how much tax you pay |

| **DRIP** | Reinvesting dividends automatically | Helps compound gains over time |
| **Loss Recovery Rate** | The % gain needed to recover from a % loss | Shows why protecting your capital is crucial |

#### üìâ Loss Recovery Table

### üíº Tax Basics for Investors

| Term | What It Means |
|------|----------------|
| **Short-Term Capital Gains** | Profits from investments held under 1 year - taxed as regular income |
| **Long-Term Capital Gains** | Profits on investments held over 1 year - taxed at a lower rate (0%, 15%, 20%) |
| **Qualified Dividends** | May qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rate |
| **Capital Losses** | Can offset capital gains or up to $3,000 in regular income annually |
| **Tax-Loss Harvesting** | Selling losers to reduce your tax bill while staying invested | 

Knowing the difference in holding periods isn't just about strategy - it affects your tax bill directly.

### üß± Bonds & Interest Rates 101

| Topic | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|

| **Rates & Prices** | When interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall (and vice versa) |
| **Why It Matters** | Stocks, especially tech and growth, are affected by interest rates too - rising rates can pull prices down |
