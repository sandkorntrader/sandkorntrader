# üìà Swing Trading Starter Guide

A professional roadmap tailored to experienced professionals ready to expand beyond their 401(k) into informed swing trading and investing.

---

## üî® Build a Solid Financial Foundation

Before you swing trade, get the basics right:

| Objective | Recommended Action | Resource |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Reduce Interest Expenses** | Switch mortgage payments to bi-weekly. Paying down the principal earlier can save thousands in interest. | [Mortgage Amortization Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/amortization-calculator.html) |
| **Maximize Tax-Efficient Accounts** | Fully contribute to your 401(k) and Health Savings Account (HSA). These offer immediate tax breaks, reducing your taxable income now, and tax-deferred growth for later. | [IRS 401(k) Limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits) & [IRS HSA Limits](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969#en_US_2023_publink1000204024) |

**Analogy:** Not maxing out these accounts is like leaving money on the table‚Äîyou're missing easy tax savings that compound over time.

## üß± Core Investing: ETFs

Start simple with diversified ETFs to minimize risk:

| Index Focus                 | ETF        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small-cap                   | IWM        | Tracks the Russell 2000, offering exposure to smaller U.S. companies.       |
| Large-cap (S&P 500)         | SPY, VOO   | Tracks the S&P 500, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies.         |
| Tech-heavy (Nasdaq 100)     | QQQ        | Tracks the Nasdaq 100, focused on top non-financial tech-oriented companies.|
| Semiconductors & AI         | SMH, AIQ   | Provides exposure to major semiconductor and AI-related firms.              |
| Volatility (Market Fear)    | VXX        | Tracks short-term VIX futures, rises when market volatility increases.      |


**Analogy:** Think of ETFs as investment "bundles"‚Äîa diverse basket of assets easily traded like stocks.

## üß© Basic Trading Concepts

Here are key concepts every new trader should know:

| Term | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Bid/Ask/Spread** | The **bid** is what buyers will pay, the **ask** is what sellers want, and the **spread** is the difference. | Tighter spreads mean lower trading costs and more liquidity. |
| **Order Types** | *Market order* buys/sells at the best price right now. *Limit order* lets you name your price. *Stop order* (stop-loss) sells if price drops to a certain level. | Using the right order type can save you money and limit risk. |
| **Stop Loss / Stop Limit** | A stop loss triggers a market order if a stock falls to a certain price. A stop limit triggers a limit order at your specified price. | These help manage risk and automate exits. |
| **Trailing Stop / Trailing Limit** | A trailing stop adjusts as the price moves in your favor, locking in gains. Trailing limit does the same but uses a limit order. | Useful for protecting profits as a trade moves your way. |
| **Order Conditions** | *On the Open*: Order executes at market open. *On the Close*: Order executes at market close. *GTC (Good ‚ÄòTil Canceled)*: Order stays active until you cancel it or it‚Äôs filled. | Controls *when* your orders execute, useful for precise strategies. |
| **Trade Types** | *Cash Account*: Trades must be fully funded with cash. *Margin Account*: Lets you borrow funds from your broker to trade larger amounts (subject to regulations and risk). | Margin allows for leverage but comes with additional rules and risks. |
| **Position Sizing** | Deciding how much of your money to use per trade. | Helps manage your risk and avoid outsized losses. |
| **Order Lots** | Specifies how many shares/contracts you buy or sell in each transaction. | Standard lot sizes help with liquidity and order filling. |
| **Risk/Reward Ratio** | Weighs how much you could win versus how much you could lose. | Good traders look for trades where the upside outweighs the risk. |
| **Liquidity** | How easily you can buy or sell an asset at a stable price. | Liquid assets (like major ETFs) are easier and safer to trade. |
| **Volatility** | How much price moves up and down. | More volatility means bigger opportunities‚Äîand bigger risks. |
| **Holding Periods** | *Day trading* = same day; *swing trading* = days/weeks; *investing* = months/years. | Know your timeframe and strategy. |
| **Commissions & Fees** | Costs to make trades. | Fees eat into profits‚Äîunderstand what you pay. |
| **Slippage** | When your trade executes at a different price than expected. | Happens more in fast or illiquid markets; use limit orders when needed. |
| **Diversification** | Spreading your money across different investments. | Reduces risk if one position goes against you. |
| Take Profit | Selling to lock in gains after a price rises | Helps you secure profits and avoid losing them if prices drop again |
| Blue Chip	| Shares of big, stable, well-known companies with a strong track record (e.g., Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson) | Generally seen as safer investments, often pay regular dividends | 
| Mega Cap | Stocks of the very largest companies by market value, usually over $200 billion (e.g., Apple, Microsoft) | These companies can be more stable, heavily influence the market, and often attract institutional investors |
| Cost Basis | The original price you paid for an investment, including fees (e.g., you buy a stock at $50 per share plus $1 in fees, your cost basis is $51) | Determines your profit or loss when you sell, which affects how much tax you owe
| Averaging Down | Buying more of an investment after the price drops, which lowers your average purchase price. | This can help you recover losses if the stock rebounds, but be careful‚Äîif the price keeps falling, you could just be throwing good money after bad. |
| Loss Recovery Rate (break even recovery point)| The percentage gain needed to recover from a previous percentage loss (e.g., after a 40% loss, you need a 66.7% gain to break even) | Shows why large losses are hard to recover from, and why protecting your capital is important. |

### Loss Recovery Rate
| % Loss | % Gain Needed to Recover |
|--------|-------------------------|
|   1%   |       1.01%             |
|   5%   |       5.26%             |
|  10%   |      11.11%             |
|  20%   |      25.00%             |
|  30%   |      42.86%             |
|  40%   |      66.67%             |
|  50%   |     100.00%             |
|  60%   |     150.00%             |
|  70%   |     233.33%             |
|  80%   |     400.00%             |
|  90%   |    900.00%              |

To better understand this, you can compare the losses and subsequent recoveries of QQQ and TQQQ from 2022 to 2024.

### Cost Basis Information Tracking

When you sell investments, your *cost basis* determines your taxable gain or loss. There are different accounting methods:

- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** The first shares you bought are the first sold.
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** The last shares you bought are the first sold.
- **Low-cost:** Sells the shares with the lowest purchase price first (maximizing gains).
- **High-cost:** Sells the shares with the highest purchase price first (minimizing gains).
- **Tax-sensitive:** Some brokers automatically optimize sales to minimize your tax liability.

Tracking your cost basis method can affect your tax bill, so choose the method that fits your goals.

---

### DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan)

**What it is:**  
When you enroll in a DRIP, any dividends you earn are automatically used to buy more shares (even fractional shares) of that stock or ETF instead of being paid out as cash.

**Why it matters:**  
This allows your investment to compound over time. For swing traders, most people disable DRIP so they have cash on hand for new trades.

---

### Liquidity (Analogy)

Think of liquidity like selling your used vehicle. If your car is a sought-after model, there are plenty of interested buyers, and you can quickly sell at a fair market price. If your car is rare or not in demand, you might have trouble finding buyers, wait longer to sell, or have to accept a much lower price than you wanted. In markets with poor liquidity, the same thing happens‚Äîit can be harder and more costly to complete your trade.

Major ETFs and large-cap stocks generally have excellent liquidity. Thinly traded, low volume stocks usually do not.

## üöß Avoid Common Pitfalls

**Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule:** Limits frequent trading in margin accounts with less than $25,000. Avoid by using cash accounts or spacing trades beyond one day.

**Wash Sale Rule:** Occurs if you sell at a loss and buy back the same or similar asset within 30 days, disallowing tax deduction. IRAs, HSAs, and similar accounts are exempt from this rule, providing flexibility for frequent trading.
